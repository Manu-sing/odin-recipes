# odin-recipes
This is my first full Odin project. At the end of it I will have demostrated to be able to:
- create new directories and files from the terminal
- create a new repository on GitHub
- clone it on my local machine
- edit the README.md file
- stage it and commit it
- push my work to GitHub
- make a recipe website with Html
- publish the site on the web via GitHub
